Introduction

Welcome to the user's guide for CHIRON, an MSDOS-based program
for accessing the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project CD-ROM. 
CHIRON is written by Cellar Door Software and is provided as
shareware. The concept of shareware is discussed on page 2 of
this document, CHIRON's registration form can be found in
APPENDIX C.  Please feel free to share copies of this program
with colleagues who might also find it useful.

Using CHIRON you can search the Greek texts on the TLG CD-ROM D
for specific words or patterns, browse texts for any author and
work combination, examine the canonical information for any
work, and print or save sections of any of the texts, plus much
more. The following table lists many of CHIRON's features.  The
details of these features are discussed in other portions of
this document.

CHIRON version 1.0 partial feature list :.

On-line help

The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, or TLG, is on ongoing project of
the University of California at Irvine and is directed by Dr.
Theodore Brunner.  The goal of the TLG project is no less than
to place every existent word of ancient Greek text into
electronic form.  Begun in 1969, the project has to date placed
over 60 million words of verified Greek texts into its database.
 In 1985, the TLG began to distribute the texts, along with
index, citation and canonical information on compact disks.  
The current version of the data, the TLG CD-ROM D,  contains
over 9000 works by 4000 authors ranging from 750 B.C.  to 600
A.D.  For more information on the TLG project or to arrange to
obtain the TLG CD-ROM contact the TLG project directly at :

Attn.: Betsy Shanor

CHIRON is distributed free to anyone who asks for it.  Current
users of CHIRON may give it to friends and associates, provided
they have not modified it in any way, and they charge no money
for the software. This concept, sometimes called shareware,
allows users to obtain and evaluate high-quality software
without having to pay for it first. Shareware authors can offer
powerful, quality programs at reasonable prices because they do
not need to provide expensive distribution and packaging. If
after evaluating a shareware program you find it useful, novel
or entertaining you should register it.  CHIRON is not free nor
is it in the public domain.

Registering the Program

Document Conventions

**************************************************************************************** 
 This document is an ASCII approximation of the fully formatted document you
 will receive when you register CHIRON. As such it contains all the same
 information as the fully formatted version but it's layout and appearance will
 be rougher and any imbedded graphics will be missing.
****************************************************************************************
Greek in this document is written in TLG Beta code format ( See
Appendix A for more information on Beta code). To enter a
pattern in Greek, type the keys on your keyboard corresponding
to the Beta code characters.  Beta code  uses the * character to
indicate that the following letter is a capital, however in
CHIRON you can type either upper- or lower-case letters and the
appropriate Greek character will be displayed.

Command keystrokes are indicated by placing angle brackets (<>) 
around the key name or key combination. For example <Alt-F>
means press the Alt and F keys at the same time, and <Return>
means press the carriage return key.

Menu options are indicated by italicizing and underlining.  For
example Search  represents the Search option on the [T]ext menu.
Menu names are bold faced and have their first letter within
square brackets.System Requirements

CHIRON is designed to run on inexpensive PC and 100% compatible
computer systems.  CHIRON provides reasonable performance on
these systems so that the cost of purchasing computer hardware
is not a deterrent to using the TLG CD-ROM

The following  table  shows the minimum configuration required
to run CHIRON version 1.1:

CHIRON version 1.1 minimum configuration:

IBM PC or 100% compatible.
640 K memory ( RAM ).
1 floppy drive.
CGA compatible graphics.
CD-ROM Drive using Microsoft extensions or similar driver.
DOS 3.3 or later version.
The TLG CD-ROM D

Optional Equipment:

Epson FX-80 or compatible printer. ( Must support FX-80 style   
  down-loadable fonts ).


 ABOUT CELLAR DOOR SOFTWARE

Cellar Door Software is a small group of highly experienced 
programmers organized to work on unique software projects
outside of our regular professional work. CHIRON represents more
than 3 and a half person years of labor, accumulated 3 hours at
a time after work.  Our members have programming experience on a
wide range of computer platforms from IBM PCs to CRAY
supercomputers, but we are new to the study of the Greek
literature so we will appreciate any comments on or
recommendations for future additions to CHIRON.

 Cellar Door Software is in no way affiliated with the
University of California or the TLG project.

REPORTING PROBLEMS OR BUGS

If you discover a bug in CHIRON, or any form of incorrect
result, please report it to us so that we can fix it. There are
a few steps you can take to make our job of reproducing and
correcting the error easier.  First, please use the bug report
form included in Appendix D of this document. Second, record as
nearly as possible the actions you were attempting when the
error was detected and the exact error message or program
behavior after the error.  Finally, please indicate the hardware
configuration you are using.   We will make every attempt to
isolate the problem and provide fixes.  Of course registered
users will receive priority.

PRINTER SUPPORT ( why only Epson FX-80 and compatibles ? )

This initial version of CHIRON provides the ability to print to
Epson FX-80 or compatible printers.  This printer was chosen for
its versatility, low price and the large number of printers that
emulate it. In addition, writing printer drivers is a time
consuming and tedious task.  As registered users make requests
for additional printer drivers, we will develop them and provide
them to all interested users and include them in future CHIRON
releases.  Providing a single versatile printer driver has
allowed us to include printing in version 1.1 of CHIRON without
writing printer drivers that users may not need.



Starting CHIRON

Prior to running CHIRON for the first time you must install it
onto your computer and configure it correctly for your hardware.
CHIRON is distributed with an automatic installation and
configuration program called INSTALL.  The INSTALL program is
discussed in detail in Appendix E of this document. Before
proceeding, refer to Appendix E and install and configure CHIRON
if you have not already done so. 

Once CHIRON has been successfully installed, you should be able
to start CHIRON by typing CHIRON at the MS-DOS prompt, for
example:

		C:>chiron <return>

CHIRON will display the user interface and then begin an
initialization process that takes about a minute.  You will see
a row of menus and buttons across the top labeled [H]elp,
[F]ind, [T]ext, [I]nfo, [O]utput, and [Q]uit.  Below these are
four text-entry fields labeled [P]attern,  [A]uthor, [W]ork, and
[C]itation.  Below these is a larger rectangular area in which
Greek text will be displayed..

Notice that the labels on the buttons, menus and entry fields
have a bracketed character.  You can press the button, display
the menu or select the entry field by pressing the <Alt> key and
this bracketed letter simultaneously. The currently selected
menu or entry field button will be highlighted.

For example to press the help menu button, labeled [H]elp, you
would press and hold the 'ALT' key and then press the 'H' key.
You should now see a menu with three options: Keyboard,
Patterns, Commands.  To select an option, position the
highlighted bar over that option with the up and down arrow keys
and then press <Return>.  To leave the menu without choosing an
option press <Escape>.

If you selected the [P]attern entry field by pressing <Alt-P>,
the [P]attern label would be highlighted and you could then
enter a pattern, in Greek, for which to search in the TLG.  If
instead you selected the [A]uthor field with <Alt-A>, you could
enter the author name in Latin characters.

The text display area does not have a label, but you can select
it by pressing <Alt-R> ( You can use the mnemonic 'R' for Read
).  This window is where CHIRON will display the Greek texts it
retrieves from the TLG CD-ROM.  In addition to Greek, you will
see beta code escape characters that are used to indicate
non-alphanumeric items contained in the original texts.  For
additional information on these escape characters see the TLG
document titled "Beta code Manual".

Command Summary

CHIRON provides access to it's functionality through menus,
buttons and pop-up widgets. This section provides an
introduction to the commands provided by CHIRON. Each of
CHIRON's menus is discussed in turn. All options are described
and where appropriate the function key equivalent to selecting
the menu option directly is presented.  The function key
shortcut is shown in angle brackets just to the right of the
menu option name.

Help Menu

Pressing <Alt-H> displays the [H]elp menu.  This menu contains
the following options:

Keyboard

Displays a window showing the Beta code to keyboard mappings
used by CHIRON.  This mapping is identical to the TLG Beta code
in most cases.  See Appendix A for more information.

Patterns

Displays a brief summary of CHIRON's pattern specification
characters and syntax.  See the section titled Searching for
more information on patterns.

Commands

CHIRON assigns function keys to certain menu options. Selecting
the Commands option from the [H]elp menu displays these function
key shortcuts. 

Find Menu

 The [F]ind menu groups together the actions and options used
for searching for patterns in the word list and text, and for
authors in the author list. See the sections on Searching and
Browsing for more detailed information on these menus. This menu
has the following options:

Works That Contain Pattern		<F2>

Find all the works that contain the current pattern, as
displayed in the [P]attern entry field.  This option produces a
list of authors and works which contain this pattern.

Pattern in Word List			<F1>

Find and display all the words in the word list index file that
match the current pattern as displayed in the [P]attern entry
field.All Matches in All Text

Find and display all of the matches for the pattern currently
contained in the [P]attern entry field.  This option searches
all of the TLG text files directly and may be very slow. 

Authors		<F3>

Find and display all of the authors whose name begins with the
string currently displayed in the [A]uthor entry field.

Ignore Diacriticals

Include Diacriticals

Choose whether or not diacriticals should be ignored in
subsequent searches. These options are mutually exclusive
toggles. For example, selecting the Ignore Diacriticals option
will cause all subsequent searches to ignore any diacritical
characters and will change the  option name in the menu to
Include Diacriticals. See Appendix A for a list of Beta code
diacritical characters.

Text Menu

The [T]ext menu includes options for retrieving and searching
Greek text files. See the section on Browsing and Searching for
more information on these options.

Get Current Work	<F4>

Retrieve and display the text of the work currently indicated by
the [A]uthor and [W]ork entry fields.

Get Next Work		<F5>

Retrieve and display the text of the next work in the current
work list. The work list may be generated by a pattern search or
an author search. If all the works in the work list for the
current author have been retrieved this option will
automatically go to the next author.

Search

Search the current work for the pattern displayed in the
[P]attern entry field.

Go To Citation		<F7>

Search the current work and display the line corresponding to
the citation in the [C]it. entry field. Citations are entered in
the general format  v.w.x.y.z . Some of these values may be left
blank. To see the citation system for the current work use the
Citation Info option from the [I]nfo menu.

Set Context		<Alt-N>

Set the number of lines to check in the case of combination
searches, and to use when printing and saving text.

Info Menu

The [I]nfo menu has options that display information on various
aspects of the current work.

Canon Info

Display the canon record for the currently displayed work in
bibliographic format. This display usually contains information
on the publisher, year of publication, author or editor for the
source of the displayed text. Additional information may also be
shown.

Citation Info

Show the current complete  citation for the highlighted line of
the work currently displayed in the text window.

Output Menu

The [O]utput menu has options for printing and saving text and
other information. All printing options require that CHIRON be
configured with a supported printer and that the printer be
connected and turned on. All saving options save information to
a disk file named chrnsave.btx by default. This filename may be
changed each time a saving option is selected.

Print Current Citation		<F8>

Print the currently highlighted line and all the lines within
the current context.

Print All Matches

Print text in all works with matches for the current pattern as
displayed in the [P]attern entry field. Each match is printed
within the current context and with complete citation
information.

Print Canon Information

Print the complete TLG canon record in bibliographic format for
the currently displayed work.

Save Current Citation		<F9>

Save the currently highlighted line and all the lines within the
current context to a disk file. The text will be saved in beta
code. The default filename of this file is chrnsave.btx.

Save All Matches

Save text in all works with matches for the current pattern.
Each match is written to a disk file in beta code format along
with the current context number of lines. The default filename
for this file is chrnsave.btx.Save Canon Information

Save the complete TLG canon record for the currently displayed
work in bibliographic format to a disk file.  The default name
for this file is chrnsave.btx .

Quit Button

When you press the [Q]uit button (by typing <Alt-Q>) , the
program will ask you if you really want to quit.  If you answer
Yes, by pressing the <y>, CHIRON will exit and return you to the
MS-DOS prompt. Answering No or pressing <Escape> will return you
to CHIRON.

Pattern Entry Field

The [P]attern field is used to enter a pattern or combination of
patterns for which to search in the TLG text.  Text in this
field will appear as Greek. The text is entered into this field
as beta code.  See Appendix A for more information on beta code.

The entry fields can also have an associated list of values that
appears directly beneath the field.  For instance, if you typed
a pattern into the [P]attern entry field and then selected the
command All Patterns in WordList from the [F]ind menu, CHIRON
would generate a list of matching words and display these in a
list below the [P]attern field.  You may choose any word from
this list by highlighting it using the arrow keys and pressing
<Return>.

Once the list has been generated it is associated with the field
until a new pattern is entered.  To select a different item from
the list select the entry field by typing <Alt-P> and then type
<Return>.  The list will reappear and you can make a new
selection.

See the section below on Searching and Browsing for more
information on entering search patterns.

Author Entry Field

The [A]uthor field is used to enter the name of an author whose
works you want to examine, or to display the name of an author
generated automatically by some action of the program.  Text in
this field is in the Latin alphabet corresponding exactly to the
character typed.

Like the [P]attern field the [A]uthor entry field can also have
an associated list.  In fact, since the author name is difficult
to enter exactly, you may want to enter an approximate name and
then choose the Authors option from the [F]ind menu.  This will
generate a list of authors that begin with the string currently
displayed in the [A]uthor entry field. For example, if the
[A]uthor entry field contains the string 'Soph', selecting  the
Authors option from the [F]ind menu will produce a list
containing the following authors:  Sophilus Comic. , Sophocles
Junior Trag. , Sophocles , Sophonias Phil.  and  Sophron Mimogr.

Work Entry Field

The [W]ork field is used primarily to display the name of the
current work. While it is possible to enter the name of a work,
it is generally fruitless to do so since it not possible within
CHIRON to determine an author from the name of the work.  Since
the author must be known to find the text of that author's
works,  you must specify an author and then choose a work from
the list of work names generated by CHIRON.  The [W]ork entry
field may have a list associated with it.  This list is usually
a subset of the works of the author currently displayed in the
[A]uthor entry field.

Citation Entry Field

The [C]it. field is used to enter or display the current
citation (excluding the author number and  work number).  This
field is updated automatically when you browse through a work. 
You can also enter a citation and have CHIRON move to that
position in the text by selecting the Go To Citation option of
the [T]ext menu.

Note that the citation will look different depending on the work
because different works employ different citation systems.  To
determine the citation system of the current work, choose the
Citation Info option from the [I]nfo menu.

Text Window

The text window is used to display retrieved works when you are
browsing or searching the text.  The text appears in Greek and
regular ASCII characters where the  text is non-Greek ( e.g.
Latin, German or English ). Greek text is displayed with
complete diacriticals.  Embedded beta escape codes are also
displayed in ASCII characters.

The line of text to which the current citation applies will be
highlighted. You can use various keys to move around within the
text.  These keys are summarized in the table on the next page.up arrow 	move back one line 

down arrow 	move forward one line 

page up 	move back 5 lines 

page down 	move forward 5 lines 

left arrow 	scroll entire window contents 20 characters to the
left 

right arrow 	scroll entire window contents 20 characters to the
right 





When you start CHIRON the frame around the text window will
appear as dashed lines.  When the text window is selected,
indicating that you can scroll through the text with the above
keys, the text window frame will become a solid line.  The frame
will become a dashed line again when you select one of the entry
fields.  To re-select the text window type <Alt-R>.

Searching and Browsing

You will probably be using CHIRON principally to search the TLG
data bank for particular words or patterns.  CHIRON provides
several methods for searching the TLG word list and text. Word
List Search

Word List Search

Find a matching pattern or set of patterns in the TLG word list
index. This technique is used to generate a list of words from
the master TLG word list index that match the pattern currently
displayed in the [P]attern entry field.  You can choose an exact
form, examine a list of words that contain a common root, or
determine the number of times each word in a set is used.

Indexed Text Search

Find the set of works in which a pattern or combination of
patterns is used.  This technique uses the TLG indices to
significantly increase the speed of searching all of the TLG
texts.  After determining the works in which the patterns occur
you can look at each match in the text one at a time or you can
print or save all the matches.

Current Work Search

Search for a pattern or combination of patterns in the currently
open work.  This method is used to examine a particular work in
detail. You can change the pattern and perform a new search on
the current work as many times as you wish.

Full Text Search

Search for an arbitrary text pattern or combination of patterns
in all of the TLG text files. This search does not use any of
the TLG index files. It performs a brute force search of all of
the TLG text files on the TLG CD-ROM.

 The first two of these methods use the TLG index files to
increase the efficiency of searching.  However the TLG word list
uses an indexing method based on the first two characters of a
word.  As long as you are searching for whole words or patterns
that have at least one character of the word at the beginning
CHIRON can employ one of the indexed search methods.  If this is
not the case CHIRON may have to use a non-indexed word list or
text file search.ENTERING WORDS AND Patterns

Depending on the type of research you are doing, you may want to
specify the search pattern in one of several different ways. 
You might be interested only in distinct words or word prefixes,
or instead, arbitrary patterns of text that span words or are
contained within words.  This section discusses how to enter
search patterns that allow you to perform the exact search you
want

Before proceeding to discuss types of patterns note that with
CHIRON you can explicitly include or exclude diacriticals within
a pattern when doing any search.  For example searching for
agaqoj while ignoring diacriticals would match both a)gaqo/j and
a(gaqo/j.  To consider diacriticals in the search-- to find
a)gaqo/j only for example-- use the Ignore/Include Diacriticals
option to Include Diacriticals on the [F]ind menu

SIMPLE WORD SEARCH

The most basic type of search is for a single word.  To CHIRON,
a word in the TLG text is any contiguous series of characters
delimited by spaces or punctuation.  Searching for the full
words agaqoj or naumaxia falls into the category of simple word
searches.  A simple word search can ignore or include
diacriticals at your discretion.

When you enter text into the [P]attern field, CHIRON assumes
that it is a word as defined above, which excludes patterns that
are contained within a word or that span words.  These more
general patterns are discussed in the following sections.

SINGLE PATTERN SEARCH

Sometimes you might wish to search for a word that is not
entirely specified.  For instance, suppose you want to search
for every Attic, non-poetic form of the dative plural of the
definite article. Only the second letter changes so you could
tell CHIRON that you want to search for the pattern T.IS, where
the . is a special character interpreted by CHIRON to match any
letter. CHIRON will generate a list which contains the desired
words ( toi=s, tai=s, toi=s ) along with some other words which
also match the pattern.

CHIRON uses the  special characters shown in the table on the
next page  to enter search patterns:CHIRON pattern matching characters

             . 	As in the example above, this character means
'match any single letter'  

              # 	This character means "match 0 or more
consecutive occurrences of the preceding character".  For
example, the pattern EL#AS would match eas, elas and ellas. 
This character is most commonly used in conjunction with the "."
character to match an arbitrarily long sequence of any
characters, for example, DEIN.# would match dein, deina,
deinainoim, etc. On text searches, the .# pattern will match up
to the end of the line on which the pattern is found.  

       < and > 	These characters are used to indicate that a
pattern does not necessarily start at the beginning of a word or
end at the end of word.  This is useful only when performing a
full text search. As an example, suppose you need to search for
the fragment "NOS, WSP". Since this potentially both divides and
spans words you would need to enter the search pattern as "<NOS,
WSP>". Any pattern that contains embedded blanks or is a
fragment of a complete word should use these characters to
guarantee the correct search is performed. The pattern <nos,
wsp> is found, for example, in Empedocles' Epigramma at the
citation .....6 





COMBINATIONS OF WORDS AND PATTERNS

Searches for a single pattern are restricted to a single line of
text, but you may need to search for patterns that are used in
conjunction but not on the same line.  CHIRON can search for
combinations of patterns that occur within the same work or
within a pre-determined number of lines. CHIRON refers to this
set of text lines as the "context".

The default value of the context is 5 lines, meaning that a
combination of patterns will be considered a match if they all
occur within 5 lines. The value of the context can be changed
with the Set Context option on the [T]ext menu or by typing
<Alt-N>. CHIRON also uses the current context value when
printing or saving text fragments.

If you choose Works That Contain Pattern from the [F]ind menu,
CHIRON will attempt to find works that contain the combination
of patterns specified in the [P]attern entry field using the
word list index before actually searching the text. While this
speeds up the process significantly, it may also result in works
being selected that do not contain the specified patterns in any
reasonable context. The other search options are not affected
since the Full Text Search option does not use the word list
index, and searching for combinations in the word using the Word
List Search option is meaningless.

The following symbols are used to search for combinations of
patterns:

          & 	This symbol allows you to search for occurrences of
(pattern A) AND (pattern B)  within a work or a certain number
of lines.  For example, you could search for agaqoj & kakoj. 

           % 	With this symbol you can search for (pattern A) OR
(pattern B) within a work. In this case a line context is not
relevant since you are actually only looking for one pattern at
a time.  An example would be searching for zeus % hera . 



          You can build expressions with these symbols using up
to five patterns.  The characters { and } can be used to
indicate priority in evaluating complex expressions.  Consider
for example the following expression:

		{ agaqoj % kakoj } & deinoj

If the context were set to 5 lines this expression would match
any occurrence of the word agaqoj or the word kakoj within plus
or minus 5 lines of the word deinoj.

GOING TO NEXT MATCH

Once you've entered a pattern and found an initial match in the
text, you can tell CHIRON to go to the next match in that work
by typing <Control-N>. If you want to go to the next match
regardless of the work in which it occurs you can use the
function key shortcut command  <F6>.BROWSING

CHIRON allows you to call up a particular text by author and
work name for browsing. In this mode you may scroll through the
text, jump to a specific citation or search for a pattern or
combination of patterns in the text.  At any point during your
browsing you may choose to print or save fragments of the text.  

To browse a particular text, simply enter the authors' name into
the [A]uthor entry field and press <Return>. Next select the
desired work from the automatically generated work list by
moving the highlighted bar to the appropriate work name and
pressing <Return>. Finally, press the function key <F4> to
retrieve the text for browsing. You may scroll through the text
using the arrow keys, Pg. Up or Pg. Dn.

Printing and Saving

Once you've found what you're looking for in the TLG text,
you'll probably want to create a permanent record.  CHIRON has
several options for printing and saving search matches or TLG
Canon Information.  Recall, however, that this version of CHIRON
requires a printer that can accept Epson FX80 style
down-loadable fonts for printing.  Fortunately this includes a
large number of inexpensive dot-matrix printers.

If you choose Print Current Citation or Print All Matches  from
the [O]utput menu and you have a printer connected and
configured for usage with CHIRON, CHIRON will print all lines
within the context of the indicated citations, along with a line
containing the citation.  In the case of Print Current Citation
, CHIRON will print the citation at which you are currently
positioned in the text window.  For Print All Matches , CHIRON
will search all necessary works and print the text at each match
that it finds. Remember that the context is set by selecting Set
Context from the [T]ext menu or by typing <Alt-N>.  Again,
CHIRON will print only those lines within the context.

The Save Current Citation and Save All Matches  options of the
[O]utput menu work similarly to the Print Current Citation and
Print All Matches   discussed above.  The output is written to a
disk file with a default filename of chrnsave.btx in beta code.

The Print Canon and Save Canon Information  options write the
complete TLG Canon information for the current work to a printer
or disk file, respectively. This canon information is identical
to  what you get with the Canon Info  option on the [I]nfo menu.
For more information on the TLG Canon see Appendix B.

Tutorial

This section of the document shows several examples of using
CHIRON, including searching the word list and text, browsing
text, and saving  results.  Before reading this section, you
might want to start CHIRON so you can try the examples as they
are presented.

BROWSING

The simplest use of CHIRON is for browsing the texts on the TLG
CD-ROM.  To use this mode you simply select an author and a work
and retrieve the text. Authors are specified by name in the
[A]uthor entry field. Works are then selected from a list
consisting of all the works by the specified author.

Example 1 : Choosing an Author and Work

 Type <Alt-A> to select the [A]uthor text entry field.  The word
[A]uthor will be highlighted indicating that the [A]uthor entry
field is active.

 Enter "Plato", without the quotation marks,  into the [A]uthor
field.  You can use the <Backspace> key to back up over any
mistakes you might make while typing or use the <Escape> key to
completely erase the field. 

 Type <Alt-F> to bring up the [F]ind menu and then choose the
Authors option. This option allows you to retrieve a list
containing all the authors whose names begin with the pattern in
the [A]uthor entry field.

 CHIRON will display a list of authors under the [A]uthor entry
field as shown above. Notice that CHIRON has highlighted the
first name on the list and placed it in the entry field
automatically. Choose "Plato Phil" from this list  by moving the
highlighted bar with the up and down arrow keys and press
<Return> when "Plato Phil" is highlighted.

 CHIRON will now display a work list under the [W]ork entry
field as shown below. Choose the third work, "Crito", from this
list by positioning the highlighted bar and pressing <Return>

 Type <Alt-T> to bring up the [T]ext menu and choose the Get
Current Work option to retrieve and display the text for Plato's
Crito. 

With the text displayed in the text window you can now scroll
through the work with the keys listed in the Text Window section
of this document. Lines longer than 80 characters can be viewed
by scrolling the text to the right using the right arrow key.
CHIRON will not allow you to scroll down past the end of the
current work, or up past the beginning, even though several
works may be contained in one text file.

Example 2 : Moving to a Specific Citation

While browsing, it is sometimes desirable to jump to a specific
location in the text directly.  CHIRON allows you to do exactly
this with the Goto Citation option on the [T]ext menu.

 Retrieve Plato's Crito as shown in Example 1, if you have not
already done so.

 Type <ALT-C> to select the [C]it. entry field.  The word [C]it.
will be highlighted.

 Enter the citation  ..47.c.6 .  Note that the citation entry
field accepts and displays only the last 5 fields of a citation.
The first fields are generated automatically from the current
author and work.

 Type <Alt-T> to bring up the [T]ext menu and select the Goto
Citation option. Alternatively you could use the function key
shortcut <F7>.

CHIRON will, after a slight pause during which it displays the
following message,

display the requested citation centered and highlighted in the
text window.  You may now use the arrow keys to scroll through
the document. 

SEARCHING THE WORD LIST ONLY

CHIRON provides the ability to search not only the TLG texts,
but also the TLG word list index. Searching the word list
indices directly may be significantly faster than searching the
text directly. The following examples illustrate the various
ways of searching the word list index files.

Example 3 : Single Word Search

 Type <Alt-P> to select the [P]attern entry field.  The
[P]attern button will highlight.

 Type the single full word AGAQOJ into the [P]attern field. This
will be displayed in the [P]attern entry field in Greek as
agaqoj. For a complete listing of the betacode to Greek
translation table see appendix A.

 Type <Alt-F> to bring up the [F]ind menu, move to the Pattern
in Word List option with the down arrow key, and press return.
The function key short cut for this action is <F1>.

CHIRON will search the TLG word list and display a list of all
words that consist of the sequence of characters AGAQOJ,
ignoring diacriticals. During this search CHIRON will display
the following message.                                          
          

While this message is displayed you may abort the word list
search at any time by pressing the <Escape> key. If at any time
during a word list search CHIRON is unable to find a match for
the pattern in the [P]attern entry field it will put up the
following  message.

 You will need to press any key and then re-enter the pattern
into the [P]attern entry field.

When the search is complete you may either select one of the
displayed words from the list displayed under the [P]attern
field or you can hit the <Escape> key to retain the original
text, agaqoj,  in the [P]attern field. If you select a pattern
by highlighting it and pressing <Return> CHIRON will
automatically generate a list of authors which contains this
word. By selecting an author from list and a work from the
subsequently generated work list and then retrieving the text
with the <F4> key, you can view an occurrence of this pattern in
the text. See Examples 7,8 and 9 for more details on searching
for and displaying patterns in the text.

Example 4 : Single Pattern with Unknown Character

You may sometimes want to search for a number of words which
differ by only a single character. CHIRON supports the . 
regular expression wildcard character to allow you to perform
this type of search. Using . as a wildcard is demonstrated in
the following example. For a more detailed description of the
wildcard characters supported by CHIRON, see the section
Searching and Browsing

 Enter the pattern AGAQ.J into the [P]attern entry field.  If
you have just done Example 3, you can do this by selecting the
field with <Alt-P> and then using the <backspace> key, remove
the last two letters from the pattern agaqoj in the [P]attern
field and then typing ".J", without quotes, to replace them.  If
you are not doing the tutorial in order you need to type the
full pattern AGAQ.J into the field.

 Type <Alt-F> to bring up the [F]ind menu and choose the 
Pattern in Word List option again.

CHIRON will again search the word list, but this time a larger
list is produced that contains all the words that match the
sequence of characters agaq.j, where the . matches any
character. Remember that you may press the <Escape> key to
cancel the search at any time. The resulting list of words
selected by this search is shown below:

Press <Return> after highlighting one of the words on the list
to generate an author list for that word or press <Escape> to
simple close the list.                                          

Example 5 : Single Pattern with Unknown Ending

CHIRON supports searching for a single pattern with an unknown
ending with the .# wildcard characters. Using these characters
you may, for instance, search for all the forms of a single word
root very easily. For a more detailed explanation of these
characters see the section on Searching and Browsing.

 Enter the pattern AGAQO.# into the [P]attern entry field.  If
you are doing the examples in order you can do this by selecting
the field with <Alt-P> and then using the backspace key, remove
the last character from the pattern agaq.j and type # to replace
it.  If you are not doing the tutorial in order you need to type
the full pattern AGAQO.# into the field.

 Press the <F1> key to invoke the Pattern in Word List option of
the [F]ind menu. 

CHIRON will once again search the word list and display a list
of matches. The first few matches on this list are shown below.

 The actual list produced by CHIRON consists of every word in
the TLG that begins with the sequence of characters agaqj
ignoring diacriticals.  This version of CHIRON will stop after
finding the first 100 words that match the pattern and it will
warn you that it has done so by displaying the following
message.                        

  If you want to ensure that you're seeing all the matches you
will have to make the search pattern more restrictive. In this
case you might change the pattern from agaqo.#  to agaqob.# .

Example 6 : Including Diacriticals

CHIRON allows you to either ignore or include diacriticals when
performing any search. When ignoring diacriticals, CHIRON uses
only the Greek characters in the pattern to determine matches in
the word list indices or Greek text. CHIRON can also include
diacriticals when determining matches. Setting CHIRON to either
include or ignore diacriticals when searching is accomplished
through a toggle on the [F]ind menu. The current state of the
toggle, Ignore Diacriticals or Include Diacriticals, is
displayed in the [F]ind menu. This example demonstrates the
usage of these options when searching the TLG word list index.

 Type <Alt-F> to bring up the [F]ind menu and position the
highlighted bar to the Ignore Diacriticals option.  Select this
option by hitting the return key. Type <Alt-F> again and you'll
see that this menu option now says Include Diacriticals. Press
the <Escape> key to leave the menu set to the Include
Diacriticals option.

 Change the pattern in the [P]attern entry field to A(GAQO.# .
Be sure and include the diacriticals in the search pattern
exactly as shown here.

 Press the <F1> key to begin the word list search. Remember that
<F1> is a shortcut for the Pattern in Word List option of the 
[F]ind menu.

Notice this time that the list only contains words that have a
rough breathing mark, ), on the A. The results of this search
are shown here.                                        

 Repeat step 1: by typing <Alt-F> and selecting the Ignore
Diacriticals option so that CHIRON will Ignore Diacriticals on
subsequent searches.

SEARCHING THE TEXT THROUGH THE WORD LIST

In addition to searching the word list index as an end to
itself,  CHIRON can use the word list index as the first step in
searching the TLG texts.  The following examples show this
feature.

Example 7 :A Particular Match of a Single Pattern

 Using the [F]ind menu, switch back to the Ignore Diacriticals
option if you have not already done so.

 Type <Alt-P>, and enter the pattern ERXEO into the [P]attern
entry field. This will be displayed as erxeo in the [P]attern
entry field..

 Type <Alt-F> to bring up the [F]ind menu and then choose the
Works That Contain Pattern option.

 After a few moments, CHIRON will display the following message.
This message tells you that CHIRON found 97 possible matches for
this pattern in the work list. After you press a key to clear
the message, CHIRON will display a list  of author names
underneath the [A]uthor entry field.  Using the down arrow key
move to the author name Archimelus Epigr., and press <Return>.

 CHIRON  now generates a list of work names for this author that
contain  the pattern and display it underneath the [W]ork field.
 Choose the work Epigramma from this list.

 Type <Alt-T> and choose the option Get Current Work. You may
also use the <F4> function key short-cut to retrieve the text.
Text will now be displayed in the text window and you will see a
line with the word )/Erxeo highlighted. Notice that the word
found in the text contains diacriticals even though the original
pattern in the [P]attern field did not. This is a because we set
the Ignore Diacriticals option on the [F]ind menu before
performing this search.

Using the keys mentioned in the Text Window section, you may
scroll through the text one line or one page at a time.  You can
also try to find the next occurrence of the pattern within this
work by typing <Ctrl-N>. When there are no more matches in the
current work CHIRON will pop-up the following message.          
                                

You can use this relatively simple series of steps to look for
any word in the TLG.  Notice that the author list is still
associated with the [A]uthor entry, so you could type <Alt-A>
and then <Return> to re-display the list and choose a new
author.  CHIRON would then generate a new work list for this
author. CHIRON always generates the correct work list every time
you choose a new author from the [A]uthor field.

Searching in this manner takes advantage of the TLG word list
index to narrow down the number of works that need to be
searched.  This  method does not work if you want to search for
a pattern that begins within a word or that spans words or
patterns for which the first two characters are unknown. CHIRON
does provide methods for searching for these types of patterns
which are discussed in examples 10 and 11 of the tutorial.

Example 8 : All Matches of a Single Pattern

Just as it is useful to be able to search for a single arbitrary
pattern in the TLG word list indices, it is also useful to
perform the same type of search on the Greek texts themselves.
The following examples demonstrate searching for patterns
containing wildcard characters in the text. These searches still
use the word lists to help speed up the search process, but the
final goal is to find the indicated patterns in the text itself.

 Enter the pattern GNWM. into the [P]attern entry field. This
will show  up in the field as gnwm   . Notice that this pattern
ends in the wildcard character . .

 Press the <F2>  key to generate a list of authors whose works
contain the pattern. Recall that pressing <F2> is a shortcut for
selecting the Works that Contain Pattern option from the [F]ind
menu

 When the author list is displayed under the [A]uthor entry
field  press <Return> to choose the first author, Theognis Eleg.

 When the work list is displayed under the [W]ork entry field
press <Return> to choose the first work, Elegiae.

 Press <F4> to retrieve the text for the current work. This is
equivalent to selecting the  Get Current Work option of the
[T]ext menu.  CHIRON will display the work with the first
pattern match  highlighted. In this case the matching word is
gnwmh

 Press <F6> to go to the next match.  If there are no matches in
this work, CHIRON will go to the next work, or even the next
author if necessary. Remember you may also use <Ctrl-N> to go to
the next match in this work only.

This sequence enables you to quickly see every match of the
specified pattern in the TLG in the work in which it occurs. 
Note however that this still uses the TLG word list so the same
restrictions apply to the patterns as in the previous examples,
namely that the pattern must contain at least two Greek
characters at the beginning and that it not span words..

Example 9 : All Matches of a Combination of Patterns

CHIRON allows you to search not only for a single pattern, but
also for combinations of patterns using the special Boolean
operators AND, &, and OR, |,. The following examples demonstrate
these features.

 Enter the combination pattern ODOS & DELFWN into the [P]attern
entry field. This will be displayed as odoj & delfwn.

 Set the context to be used by typing <Alt-N> and entering a
value of 5.  Press return to accept this value and remove the
co[n]text entry field. The co[n]text entry field is used to
specify the number of lines within which a Boolean match will be
considered successful. By setting the value to 5 in this example
we are telling CHIRON to look for the pattern odoj and the
pattern delfwn within 5 lines of each other.

 Press <F2> to generate an author list for this combination
pattern.

 Choose Sophocles Trag. from the author list.

 Choose Oedipus Tyrannus from the work list.

 Press <F4> to get the text of the first match.

This search again uses the word list to determine the set of
works to search. However, CHIRON determines only works with
possible matches.  Depending on the current value of the context
a work may or may not have an actual match. You may use the <F6>
function key shortcut to search for the next match in the
current or any other work. This example has only a single match
for these patterns and context.

SEARCHING THE TEXT DIRECTLY

In some instances it is not possible to initiate a search
through the word list index.  For example, if the first two
characters of the pattern are unknown or if the pattern spans
and or divides words. Searches of this type are still possible
and this section discusses two methods for performing such
searches.

Example 10 : Searching Within a Particular Work

If you know the particular work in which you want to search
CHIRON allows you to do a complete text search on that document.
This type of search allows you to specify patterns which could
not be searched for using the TLG word list indices. The
following example shows one such case.

 Open Plato's Crito to browse as described in Example 1 of this
tutorial.

 Type <Alt-P> to select the [P]attern entry field  and enter the
pattern <MAI EGW> exactly as shown. Note that this pattern
begins with an angle bracket, <, contains a space in the middle
and ends with another angle bracket, >. The angle brackets, <>,
inform CHIRON that this pattern may divide or span words. This
pattern will be displayed in the [P]attern entry field as <mai
egw>

 Type <Alt-T> to bring up the [T]ext menu and choose the Search
option.

CHIRON will search the current work and place you at the first
occurrence of this pattern within the work. In this particular
case the match is found at citation ..47.d.6. The actual pattern
found is embedded in the words Oi/=mai e)/gwge . You can search
for any pattern in the text, but notice that this pattern begins
in one word and ends in the next.  This method may be used to
search for any pattern in the currently open work.

Example 11 : All Matches of an arbitrary pattern in all text

In some cases it may be unavoidable to search all of the text in
the TLG for a pattern since some patterns cannot use the TLG
word list index. This type of search can be time consuming as
CHIRON must open and search every text file on the entire
CD-ROM. It will most likely be used when searching for patterns
which span words or for which the first two characters of the
pattern are unknown. This example demonstrates this type of
search for the case of a pattern which spans words.

 Enter the exact pattern < TA TE> into the [P]attern entry
field. Note that this pattern begins with an angle bracket  and
space, < , contains a space in the middle and ends with an angle
bracket,>. This pattern will be displayed as < ta te> in the
[P]attern entry field.

 Choose the All Matches in All Text option from the [F]ind menu.

CHIRON will began a systematic search of all the works contained
on the TLG CD-ROM for the indicated pattern.  When a match is
found it will be displayed and highlighted in the text window. 
For this example, the first match is found in the work Elegiae
by the author Theognis Eleg. at citation ...1.398.  Press <F6>
to have CHIRON continue the search and display the next match. 

PRINTING AND SAVING

Printing and saving are discussed together because they differ
only in the device to which you write the information.  The
printing and saving options are used for two important tasks.
First you can print or save an instance of the citation at which
you are currently positioned in the text, or you can print or
save every occurrence of a match within the TLG text for a given
pattern.  Remember that this version of CHIRON requires an Epson
FX-80 printer or compatible for printing to work correctly.

Example 12 :Printing or Saving the Current Citation

CHIRON allows you to at any time to save or print the currently
highlighted line in of a text file along with a specified
context. The following example demonstrates printing the current
citation.

 Search for the word FONON, ignoring diacriticals, in all works
using the <F2> key to invoke the search. Refer to example 7 if
you need  to refresh your memory on how to do this.

 Choose the first author and work from the lists generated by
CHIRON.

 Press <F4> to retrieve and display the matching text.

 Type <Alt-O> to bring up the [O]utput menu and choose the Print
Current Citation option.

CHIRON will print the current line plus the number of lines
before and after indicated by the value of the context. For
example a context value of 1 will result in CHIRON printing a
total of three lines.  Remember that the context can be changed
at any time by type <ALT-N> and entering a new value into the
context entry field. CHIRON will also print the full citation
entry with the text. If the printer is off-line or otherwise
unavailable for printing CHIRON will display the following
message.

Saving the text of the current citation works almost exactly
like printing except that you will be asked for a filename in
which to save the information. If the filename you specify
already exists, CHIRON will append the data to the file.  The
default filename for CHIRON output is chrnsave.btx. You can
change the output filename at any time by typing <ALT-S> and
entering a new filename in the displayed entry field. Pressing
return in this field accepts the value and makes the entry field
disappear. CHIRON also allows you to change the filename every
time you invoke one of the save to disk commands.Example 13 : Printing or Saving all the Citations

CHIRON's automated search facility makes it easy to search for a
specified pattern in a large number of works. The ability to
print or save the results of these large searches is one of
CHIRON's strongest features. The following example demonstrates
this ability.

 Enter the pattern KLEONIKE into the [P]attern entry field and 
press <F2> to generate a list of authors and works which contain
this pattern.

 Choose the first author from the author list and the first work
from the work list. You may also want to press <F4> to retrieve
the text of the first match but it is not necessary.

 Type <Alt-O> to bring up the [O]utput menu and choose the Save
All Matches option.

After prompting you to enter an output filename, CHIRON will
search through the identified TLG texts and save  the text at
each citation where it finds a match. During this process it
will display the following message.

 At any time during this process you may press <Escape> to stop
searching and saving..

Again, printing is almost identical except that you will not be
asked for a file name, the output goes to a printer and you
choose the Print All Matches  option  from the [O]utput menu.

Example 14 : Printing or Saving Canon Information

Each work included on the TLG CD-ROM has corresponding
information about the source the text.  This information is the
TLG Canon, and CHIRON will print or save the entire canon entry
for the currently selected work.

 Open any work for browsing. Refer to example 1 if you need help.

 Type <Alt-O> to bring up the [O]utput menu and choose the Print
Canon Information option.

CHIRON will print each item in the Canon entry.  A more complete
explanation of this information is in Appendix B.  The Save
Canon Info option is again the same as printing except that you
will be asked for a file name and the canon bibliography
information will be written to this file. 

An example of the canon bibliography output for the work
Historia Alexandri Magni : Recensio $G &(lib. 3 ) is shown
below.                         

Example 15 : Citation Information

After retrieving the text during a browse or search, the last 
five levels of the citation will be continually displayed and
updated in the [C]it. field.   However, you will sometimes need
more complete Citation information, especially because you will
need to know the citation system of the current work to enter a
citation when using the Goto Citation option.

 Open any work for browsing.

 Type <Alt-I> to activate the [I]nfo menu and then choose the
Citation Information option.

CHIRON will display the name and value of each field in the
current citation.

Example 16 : Canon Information

The [O]utput menu has options for printing and saving complete
canon information, but you may want to see certain items from
the Canon more directly.  The Canon Info  option of the [I]nfo
menu will display the canon information for the current work in
bibliographic format on the screen.

 Open any work for browsing.

 Type <Alt-I> and choose the Canon Info option.

APPENDIX A:  Beta Code

The TLG uses beta code to represent Greek text, including
diacriticals, with  the set of characters available on a
computer.  The table below shows the correspondence between
Greek text and computer characters used in beta code.

APPENDIX B:  Canon fields

The TLG CD-ROM 'C' contains complete canonical information for
every included work.  CHIRON can access this information and
either display a subset of it on screen or print or save the
entire canon record for a selected work.  The TLG canon record
field headings and their meanings are shown below:

APPENDIX E: Installation Guide

CHIRON is distributed with an automated installation program,
called INSTALL, to simplify the installation process. This
section will guide you through the process of installing CHIRON
and running it for the first time. INSTALL will perform the
following actions for you :

Determine hardware configuration.

Copy CHIRON files from distribution disk to their permanent
location, creating directories if necessary.

Determine printer type and port connection.

Determine CD-ROM drive logical drive letter.

Create the CHIRON configuration file, chiron.cfg

INSTALL performs two distinct functions, installation and
configuration.  It is possible to invoke the configuration
portion of install without re-installing CHIRON.  This is useful
for informing CHIRON of changes in your hardware environment and
is discussed in the section titled "Configuring CHIRON".

The installation program consists of a number of screens, with
each screen representing a specific step in the installation and
configuration process. All screens have a title window at the
top and a help window near the bottom. In addition there will be
a menu and possibly a data entry field.  The help window will
show a brief description for the current menu item or entry
field. 

Menus are navigated using the arrow keys on your keyboard, 
vertical menus use the up and down keys while horizontal menus
use the left and right arrows.  Data entry fields accept the
delete key for erasing single characters and the escape key for
clearing the entire field. Menu options are selected and entry
fields completed by pressing <Return>.

RUNNING INSTALL

To begin, insert the diskette containing the CHIRON files into
your floppy drive. Change your default drive to the drive with
the CHIRON diskette and enter INSTALL at the DOS prompt.  For
example if the current drive is C: and the CHIRON diskette is in
the A: drive of your computer, enter the following commands at
the DOS prompt to start the installation program.

		C: a:<RETURN> 
		C: install <RETURN>> 

The INSTALL program first attempts to determine your hardware
configuration to verify that it meets the  minimum requirements
of CHIRON.  If INSTALL finds that your hardware is insufficient,
it will exit immediately and display a list of the hardware
deficiencies along with CHIRON's requirements.   Since it is
virtually impossible to anticipate all hardware configurations,
INSTALL might determine your hardware to be insufficient when it
is in fact adequate.  In this case you have two options.

INSTALL can be forced to install CHIRON without performing its
hardware check by using the -F command line option.  For
example, to force the installation type:

		C: install -F

The second option is to by-pass the installation and
configuration program entirely.  To do this you need to copy the
file chiron.exe to a directory named \CHIRON off your root
directory.  You must then copy the file default.cfg to the
\CHIRON directory, renaming it to chiron.cfg.  This is a default
configuration file that assumes the following set-up :

CHIRON executable directory 	C:/CHIRON 
CHIRON data directory 	C:/CHIRON 
PRINTER installed as 	Epson FX80 on LPT1 
CD-ROM drive installed as 	D: 

If you are still unable to successfully install and configure
CHIRON, please contact us and we will help you.

Install Main Screen

The main screen gives you the options Install only, Configure
only, Both (install and configure), or Quit. If this is the
first time you are installing CHIRON  select Both.

Source Drive and Directory

Enter the drive and directory where the original CHIRON files
reside.  In most instances this will be A: and \ .  If INSTALL
can't find the CHIRON files on the drive and directory you
indicate, you can re-enter them or press <Return> to quit the
installation program.

Destination Drive and Directory

Enter the destination drive and directory where you want CHIRON
to be installed. On hard disk systems this will typically be C:
and CHIRON, respectively. On two floppy systems use B: and \. If
the directory you specify does not exist, INSTALL will create it
for you after asking for confirmation.CONFIGURING CHIRON

The configuration portion of INSTALL sets the hardware
configuration and user preferences for CHIRON.  The
configuration section can be accessed by selecting Both or
Configure only from the INSTALL main screen.  If you selected
Configure only, INSTALL will ask for the drive and directory in
which CHIRON is installed.  You will not be asked for this
information if you selected Both from the main screen as INSTALL
already knows the information in this case.

In either case, the first screen presented is the 'Configuration
main screen'.  You can abort the configuration process by
selecting No from the displayed menu..  Select Yes to continue.

Installed Drive and Directory

Enter the drive letter and directory name which contains the
installed CHIRON files. These will typically be C:\CHIRON on
hard disk systems, and B: on two floppy systems.  If INSTALL
determines that CHIRON is not installed in the directory that
you indicate, you can re-enter the drive and directory, or abort.

Data Drive and Directory

Enter the drive and directory to be used by CHIRON for writing
output data.  The default values are the same drive and
directory in which CHIRON is installed.  INSTALL will create the
directory for you if it does not already exist.

Printer Configuration and Port Selection

The Printer Configuration screen asks if an Epson FX80 or
compatible printer is to be used with CHIRON.  If you answer
Yes, the Printer Port selection screen is displayed.  This
screen allows you to select the LPT port to which your printer
is connected.  If your computer only has one parallel port, you
will be informed of this and that port will be configured
automatically.

CD-ROM Selection

Select the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive. Install will only
display those drive letters that it thinks are possible CD-ROM
drives. On most hard disk systems, the CD-ROM drive will be D:.

INSTALL will write a file called chiron.cfg to the installation
directory, and CHIRON is now ready to run.  If you have problems
or the configuration file is incorrect, please report the
problems to us using the bug report in Appendix D of this
document and we will make every effort to help you get CHIRON
installed and configured correctly.
